		<h1>Personal Projects</h1><hr>
		<p>As I mentioned in my '<a href="about.html">About</a>' section I do program for my own enjoyment. These projects usually don't have any useful purpose except to practice my programming ability. Here are some of my more fun, and or publicly available projects.</p>
		<br><h3>Wolfram|Alpha Bot</h3>
		<p>Not too long ago I took the Wolfram Alpha API, I parsed the data, and then hooked it up to the Discord API. This program is written in the ruby programming language, which is my primary scripting language. The source code for this project is locates <a href="https://github.com/6167656e74323431/WolframAlpha">here</a>, and is open source under the MIT License.</p>
		<p>This project is nearly done, however there are a few bugs that I have yet to fully eliminate.</p>

		<br><h3>Turing Complete HTML</h3>
		<p>With the introduction of CSS3 and HTML5, HTML + CSS is now Turing complete due because you can check the state of check boxes. After discovering this for myself, I thought "what's the most complex thing I can make in pure HTML and CSS"</p>
		<p>Like many of my other projects, this one is also open-source and can be found <a href="https://github.com/6167656e74323431/Turing-Complete-HTML">here</a>. So far the only components that have been implemented are the basic logic gates.</p>
		<p>I am actively working on this project, and I am working on more complex machines. If you want to play with the logic gates right now, they are on line <a href="https://6167656e74323431.github.io/Turing-Complete-HTML/">here</a>.</p>

		<br><h3>Turing Re-Write</h3>
		<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_(programming_language)">Turing Programming Language</a> is a wonderfully designed, and elegant scripting language. The language is sadly no longer supported, and the <a href="https://github.com/Open-Turing-Project/OpenTuring">open source version</a> has not received any updates in 7 years.</p>
		<p>I am currently in the preliminary stages of re-writing the Turing compiler <i>from scratch</i> to be more modern. I'm hoping to get the <i>very core</i> of the language compilable by my own compiler. I am bringing multiple improvements to the language such as STDIN/STDOUT support, and 64-bit integers.</p>
