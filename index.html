		<h1>Welcome!</h1><hr>
		<p>The AP ICS course requires a portfolio summarizing the entire course as part of the final grade. This portfolio exists not just to fulfill that requirement, but it can act as a landing page to show pf my knowledge. The bulk of the content on this portfolio is directly related to course material, however the '<a href="projects.html">My Projects</a>' section does contain a few personal endeavours.</p>
		<p>If you don’t know where to begin, I recommend going over to the '<a href="concepts.html">Concepts</a>' page and pick a tutorial and start reading. All the tutorials are of great quality and shouldn't take more than 10 minutes as they are all about 1 page in text (not including images).</p>
		<h3>Sources</h3>
		<p>All the information used in the tutorials is either taken from the course material, or from the javadoc of the referenced classes themselves. All the images used in the tutorials are created by myself for this portfolio.</p>
		<h3>Potential Issues</h3>
		<p>If you are viewing this on a local copy, and something seems off about the styles. Try viewing the <a href="https://6167656e74323431.github.io/ICS4U0-Portfolio/">online version</a> as my styles are verifyed for that version.</p>
