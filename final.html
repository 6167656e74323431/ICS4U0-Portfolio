		<p>For the final project for this course we had to work in partners to make a game of some kind. This game could be anything as long as it had the theme, overcoming adversities. The adversity that we chose to do was time-management.</p>
		<p>The game we came up with was this desktop-simulator game where you had to manage your time while doing many different tasks. We figured this would be a good idea as teenagers these days are perfectly willing to do the work (I know from experience), but they just don't know how to manage their time.</p>
		<p>The final project was done in partners, of which I chose Larry, who's name is on many other files on this portfolio (I have worked with him before). I think this was a great choice, as he is a reliable partner, who always does his work.</p>
		<p>The entire game is, or should be on the github that we created for an imaginary company which can be found <a href="https://github.com/educationallydesigned">here</a>. We are so dedicated to this project, that we even reserved a (free) domain, just so our package structure can follow proper Java conventions. The domain (<a href="http://educationallydesigned.ml">http://educationallydesigned.ml</a>) just links back to the github organization.</p>
